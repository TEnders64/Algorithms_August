  <title>Array Remove Duplicates</title>
</head>
<body>
  Sara is looking to hire an awesome web developer and has received applications from various sources. Her assistant alphabetized them but noticed some duplicates. Given a sorted array, remove duplicate values. Because array elements are already in order, all duplicate values will be grouped together.

  <script>

    function RemoveDups(){
      
    }

  </script>

</body>
</html>

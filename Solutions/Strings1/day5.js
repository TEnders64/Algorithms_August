// Book Index
// Martin is writing his opus: a book of algorithm challenges, set as lyrics to a suite of baroque fugues. He knows that some of those fugueing challenges will be less popular than others, so he needs a book index. Given a sorted array of pages, produce a book index string. Consecutive pages should form ranges separated by a dash. For [1,3,4,5,7,8,10], return the string "1, 3-5, 7-8, 10".


// Common Suffix
// Lance is writing his opus: a tome of beat poetry. Always looking for a good rhyme, he seeks words ending with the same letters. Write a function that, given a word array, returns the largest common suffix (word-end). For inputs ["deforestation", "citation", "conviction", "incarceration"], return "tion" (not a very creative starting point). If it is ["nice", "ice", "baby"], return "".
